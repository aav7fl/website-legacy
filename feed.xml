The Works with Nest program allows third-party applications like Home Assistant and IFTTT to integrate with Nest products. Without this ability to integrate, Nest products are worthless to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After much outcry, Google decided to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.google/products/google-nest/updates-works-with-nest/&quot;&gt;back off&lt;/a&gt; on their aggressive shutdown target date. They also clarified that services like Alexa would be exempt from this change. Unfortunately, the death sentence has only been extended and without a doubt will still be shutdown in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-wrong-with-nest&quot;&gt;What’s Wrong with Nest&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like Nest. Their support has always been top-notch. When I first purchased my Nest E thermostat, the customer service paid to have an electrician rewire our HVAC to be compatible. I’ve been recommending them for years because of that experience. It hit me like a train when they announced they were winding down their developer program. All I could think about was how I wasn’t going to be able to use their products the way &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; wanted to, but the way &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted me to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-i-fix&quot;&gt;What Can I Fix&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know what you’re thinking. I made a terrible decision going with the company that had a cloud-based API. You’re mostly correct. However, when I purchased the Nest products, it made sense. I didn’t have any home automation platforms, and I didn’t have the time to build one during my moving situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Going forward, I will favor edge computing and APIs that can be accessed locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing full well that I was in need of a new solution, I started looking at what problems I was  having and how I could improve with the next iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;problem-1-avoid-cloud-apis-like-the-plague&quot;&gt;Problem 1: Avoid Cloud APIs Like the Plague&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thermostat needed to be replaced if I was to continue using it in the same way. A device that usually stays in your house for &lt;em&gt;decades&lt;/em&gt; hadn’t passed its second birthday. I &lt;em&gt;thrilled&lt;/em&gt; to be buying a new thermostat so soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This transformation led me down the path of seeking &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-Wave&quot;&gt;Z-Wave&lt;/a&gt;, a wireless communications protocol commonly used in home automation. I was seeking full control of a device that I could communicate with even if the Internet went out. This meant avoiding Wi-Fi based thermostats because I felt that most of the options weren’t that great unless I was ready to spend large sums of money. I was still getting over the burn of my Nest E thermostat purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After digging through a few reviews and recommendations, I settled upon the Radio Thermostat CT101. Honestly, it looks like it came out of the 1980s. It’s ugly– but it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; functional.. So.. ✅? I guess..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2019/05/2019-05-21_20-05-12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My thermostat that fell out of 1982&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;My thermostat that fell out of 1982&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick installation of the new thermostat and I was good to go. Within an hour I had it paired with my Z-Wave stick on my Home Assistant, and another two hours later I had completed flows in Node-RED for temperature scheduling and home/away temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;problem-2-cameras-shouldnt-break-without-internet&quot;&gt;Problem 2: Cameras Shouldn’t Break Without Internet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nest camera had a critical flaw. If the Internet went out, it stopped working!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was essential that I replace the Nest camera with one that allowed for local streaming and recording to the device if something went down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of throwing more money at the problem, I decided to go the hobbyist route. After getting some strong recommendations for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076H3SRXG&quot;&gt;Wyze 2 cameras&lt;/a&gt; from my coworkers, I decided to pick one up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was excited to use the Wyze 2 camera because they recently announced their beta firmware was adding support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Streaming_Protocol&quot;&gt;RTSP&lt;/a&gt;. This feature would allow me to stream the network video to any local device that I wanted, bypassing the Internet completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2019/05/2019-05-24_19-04-27.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wyze 2 Camera&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wyze 2 in its full glory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn’t too much to say about them. They are &lt;em&gt;super cheap&lt;/em&gt; and it shows. It doesn’t have a 130° wide-angle lens that my Nest camera had. The compression in the video is pretty extreme. It also seems unable to fully illuminate the room with its weak infrared lamps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, it’s less than 1/8 the price of the cheapest Nest camera. It has no subscription cost, doesn’t require Internet, and can record locally on an SD card. If it really bothers me, I can pick up half a dozen more before it approaches the same price of my Nest camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the cheap Wyze 2 camera wins for today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;problem-3-roomba-is-my-pet&quot;&gt;Problem 3: Roomba is My Pet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On quite a few occasions, my Nest camera would send me &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; alerts when it saw my Roomba by chugging along. Nest wasn’t the only one who didn’t recognize the Roomba though. Support thought it was my pet! &lt;em&gt;Although they might be partially correct on that&lt;/em&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2019/05/2019-05-07-09-21-17.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chat conversation with Gary from customer support&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is Roomba your pet?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can I do to fix this? A few months back, I remembered that Home Assistant had announced support for TensorFlow as an integration. Given that I had recently moved my entire set up onto an Intel NUC, I figured this would be an excellent usage of my extra CPU cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan was to stream everything locally, run motion detection on the images, hand them off to TensorFlow, and check to see if any unexpected humans were in frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was kind of like playing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/not-hotdog/id1212457521&quot;&gt;Not HotDog&lt;/a&gt; game from Silicon Valley. The critically acclaimed app determines whether an object is a hot dog, or &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a hot dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t trying to categorize every kind of object in every single frame. I just wanted to know if anything in frame was either human, or &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; human. A &lt;em&gt;fairly simple&lt;/em&gt; model to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;approaching-humannot-human&quot;&gt;Approaching Human/Not Human&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here was the plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use Wyze 2 camera with RTSP enabled&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Capture the RTSP stream inside &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Detect motion so I’m not running TensorFlow 24x7&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Send me a notification if there is a person (who shouldn’t be there)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In under a few seconds I should be able to detect a person walking near a camera and be immediately notified of their presence. I still don’t know &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; the person is, but I can’t imagine it’s too difficult to capture faces from TensorFlow and send them through a trained network of known faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I decided to use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md&quot;&gt;faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco&lt;/a&gt; model based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://josiahvorst.com/image-processing-made-easy-home-assistant-tensorflow/&quot;&gt;recommendation from this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part about my plan is that all of it (except the Pushover notification) was supposed to be handled locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taking-my-camera-to-the-next-level&quot;&gt;Taking My Camera to the Next Level&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my bundle of new cameras, it was time to make them smart. I set up a camera in the front of my house to keep an eye on my car and track people approaching the front door. My original plan was to use the outline mentioned above and notify me via Pushover when it detects a person. But it seemed to work a little too well…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2019/05/2019-05-23_17-35-27.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Person on the other side of the road&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;That person is pretty far away&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While testing, I was noticing that it was picking up people all the way across the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ok&lt;/em&gt;. I guess I can handle this by restricting the area that tensor flow is looking at. So let me chop off the top 35% of the image area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2019/05/2019-05-23_17-49-29.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;I duck to trigger a valid capture&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ducking to trigger a valid event&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ok&lt;/em&gt;. Now it only works if the person happens to crawl up to my window. Because my camera isn’t high enough, it doesn’t know when a person’s head is in the foreground or the background and it can’t efficiently detect them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;solving-the-depth-perception&quot;&gt;Solving the Depth Perception&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, Google AI &lt;em&gt;JUST&lt;/em&gt; put out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/05/moving-camera-moving-people-deep.html&quot;&gt;blog post about depth prediction&lt;/a&gt;. But I don’t think that would’ve worked very well in my cheap cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you notice when a person gets closer to the camera? The bounding box TensorFlow provides becomes larger. Because TensorFlow is already giving me &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;xmin&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;xmax&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ymin&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ymax&lt;/code&gt;, I can calculate the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;area&lt;/code&gt; of the bounding box to get a rough estimate if target is closer or farther away from the camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set up a Node-RED prototype flow to log the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;area&lt;/code&gt;, grabbed my iPad, and ran outside. I repeatedly triggered the capture so TensorFlow produce the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;area&lt;/code&gt; result based on where I was standing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stood on one side of the sidewalk, hit the button, and took note of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;area&lt;/code&gt; result. Then I stood by my car and repeated the process. I kept doing this for a handful of different locations while striking beautiful poses to give the system a variety. After a few minutes, I had a good idea of what kind of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;area&lt;/code&gt; numbers I needed for determiners on distance from the camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2019/05/2019-05-23_18-58-26.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Example capture of two people&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if there is more than one person?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ok&lt;/em&gt;. But what if there are two people in frame, and they are really far away from each other? While testing out my flow, I realized that if there was more than one person in frame, and the first person I detect is too far away, my entire flow would stop after the first failure. With a little bit of JavaScript-fu I needed to break apart all of the returned objects from TensorFlow. This allowed me to address each result individually to know if it met all criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2019/05/2019-05-24_15-30-19.png&quot; alt=&quot;My Node-RED flow&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Node-RED flow for the outdoor camera: (&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/files/2019/05/front-window-node-red-flow.js&quot;&gt;front-window-node-red-flow.js&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success! It’s finally working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;camera-setup&quot;&gt;Camera Setup&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A Wyze 2 camera is recording and streaming a scene through RTSP.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The stream is picked up by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneye&quot;&gt;motionEye&lt;/a&gt; which:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Re-broadcasts&lt;/em&gt; the stream to Home Assistant as MJPEG (so I’m not picking the stream up twice from each camera increasing the load on them).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Calls a webhook in Home Assistant for the start of each motion event.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Home Assistant webhook sends a MQTT message for every new motion event.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In Node-RED, I pick up the MQTT messages and treat them like a stream.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If the messages keep coming in, continue running TensorFlow on a camera stream.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If the messages stop, my timer runs out and I stop running TensorFlow on the camera stream.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If TensorFlow detects a person:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Split up all person objects into separate results.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Check the confidence level of each result. If it’s not high enough, ignore it. If it is high enough, continue.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Check the total area of each results. If the total area exceeds something that I would deem close to the camera, continue.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If there is a captured result from TensorFlow that passes all of my validations, notify me with the image via Pushover. Or at the very least, log the image somewhere that I can review later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;outdoor-camera-flow&quot;&gt;Outdoor Camera Flow&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, this is the outdoor camera flow simplified:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everyone is gone
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Movement is detected
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Movement looks like a person?&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;The confidence level of the person is fairly high?&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;The area of the detected person is fairly large?&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Send me a low priority alert with the image&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;indoor-camera-flow&quot;&gt;Indoor Camera Flow&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inside camera flow is laughably easier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everyone is gone
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Movement is detected
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Movement looks like a person?&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Take evasive actions!&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sad to leave Nest. They have beautiful products that work very well. Well… &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; since Google has re-branded the Home Hub as the Nest Hub, I haven’t &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; left them. But that doesn’t make a very good title, does it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m excited to use edge computing rather than cloud computing for analysis. I’m enjoying my approach of  decoupling my home automation from being Internet reliant. Unlike Nest cameras, my devices will &lt;em&gt;still have basic functionality&lt;/em&gt; if there is an internet outage. More problems have been solved that I hope do not crop up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a fun project to apply TensorFlow data models on low-budget cameras to gain (in my opinion)  superior image recognition. I continue my quest of home automation with more lessons learned. Too bad my Roomba will no longer be labeled as a person. I’m sure he’ll miss that. 🤖&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;image&quot;=&gt;&quot;/assets/img/kyle.jpg&quot;, &quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;&quot;CrypticCitrus&quot;}</name></author><category term="large project" /><summary type="html">A few weeks ago, Google announced the shutdown of its Works with Nest developer program only 16 weeks in advance.

It’s night time. You’re winding down and the end of a long work day getting for sleep. You climb into bed and pull the cozy covers up to your neck. Rolling over, you whisper a command to your digital assistant to turn off the lights. The room goes dark but something feels different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A creaking noise of the house cuts through your silent slumber as the duct above expands with the furnace. Pestering you awake, it dawns on you that you’ve forgotten to turn on the noise machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trek is cold and dangerous. After gathering the willpower, you slide out of the bed. Your feet scurry across the frozen carpet until reaching the pedestal under then noise machine. The button clicks after a quick press and your hand coils back into its warm sleeve. It brings to life an orchestra of synthetic crickets. You can now sleep in peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you never needed to make that dangerous trek? Your feet could stay warm, the monsters couldn’t grab you, and your hand could stay under your pillow? That’s a question I asked myself all winter long. Eventually, I decided to do something about that. I wanted to control my noise machine using my voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;solving-a-fabricated-nuisance&quot;&gt;Solving a Fabricated Nuisance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that I love using my voice. I sing along to custom soundtracks in Beat Saber (here’s my &lt;a href=&quot;https://scoresaber.com/u/76561198019635216&quot;&gt;Score Saber&lt;/a&gt; plug), and I write large portions of these posts using dictation software. For this reason, I wanted to set a primary goal of controlling my noise machine using my voice. Bonus points if I could get it to integrate with my favorite home automation platform, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant&quot;&gt;Home Assistant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my Home Assistant instance is already connected to my Google Home, I could expose and control any Home Assistant entity to Google as a controllable device. This means easier voice integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I had to do was disassemble my &lt;a href=&quot;https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01H6WXUX8/&quot;&gt;noise machine&lt;/a&gt; to see what I was up against. I scraped off the bottom foam feet, sourced myself a skinny screwdriver, and went to work at removing the screws. Once I was inside, I found how much empty space I had to work with. A lot! I took a look at the board and it had a very forgiving soldering pins. This excited me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2019/02/noise_machine_before.png&quot; alt=&quot;Empty noise machine before I started hacking it&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Empty noise machine before hacking it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before progressing, I wanted to make sure all the pieces I needed were available. I pulled out my multimeter and began to investigate how the box worked. Conveniently, the box is powered with a 5V line with batteries as a backup. With my &lt;del&gt;super basic&lt;/del&gt; extreme electronic skills, I noticed that if I bridged the connections on the button, it would trigger its action–so like… a normal button. Simple enough, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, it dawned on me that a friend had gifted me an ESP32 board for Christmas a few years back. Until now, I hadn’t thought of a good project for it. Due to the generous space inside the noise machine, I knew it would be possible to fit an amateur wiring job inside without too many issues and possibly control the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prototyping&quot;&gt;Prototyping&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a quick Google search, I learned that the Home Assistant platform that recently launched an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.home-assistant.io/components/esphome/&quot;&gt;ESPHome integration&lt;/a&gt;. Lucky for me, ESPHome &lt;a href=&quot;https://esphome.io/devices/nodemcu_esp32&quot;&gt;supports for my board&lt;/a&gt;! A quick firmware flash and Home Assistant integration change later, I was able to produce a proof of concept that toggled an LED bulb on the ESP32 through the control of my Home Assistant front-end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucky for me, the ESP32 board that I was using required a 5V power source. Conveniently, the noise machine was already using a 5V line for its main power. I just tapped into that and it worked perfectly. I don’t &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; I’m drawing enough current to cause any problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Method to implement AMP-Video. --&gt;

&lt;video width=&quot;700&quot; controls=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/files/2019/02/noise_machine_prototyping.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Your browser doesn’t support HTML5 video&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfect. It looked like all the pieces were going to line up. I just had to figure out how to create a circuit using the ESP32 that would trigger a button press. A quick search online suggested that these button presses could be bypassed by using an NPN transistor to behave like a switch. This would allow me to change the voltage passing between the two button terminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed some parts, so I visited my neighbor to borrow two transistors. While over there, I had my breadboard sliced in half so it would fit inside the noise machine. Once I returned home, I tossed a bunch wires together, positioned my transistor and suddenly had a working prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I don’t work on projects like this very often, I had a measly supply of resistors and nonexistent supply of transistors/wires. Honestly, this was probably the best time for me to stock up on proper parts like this. I put in an order and anxiously waited for them to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building&quot;&gt;Building&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we live in the future, the order took less than 48 hours to arrive. Once I had all my new parts opened, I went to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m nowhere near experienced at this work. I like to think I’m competent enough to get by. If you’re trying to follow along at home, I’d advise against it. I have no idea what I’m doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a high level overview (I tried my best) showing my circuit. I’m not quite sure how to represent everything very well…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2019/02/noise_machine_wiring.svg&quot; alt=&quot;ESP32 circuit to control noise machine power button&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;A high level look at the ESP32 circuit  controlling my noise machine power state&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost immediately I thought I had my circuit ready. But something wasn’t quite right. With my circuit connected, if I tried to use the physical button on the machine, it wouldn’t work. I realized I had probably created a parallel circuit so now the connection was going the path of least resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to come up with a solution, I attempted to swap the NPN transistor with a PNP variant. But that was heading in the wrong direction and didn’t work. Backtracking, I swapped out the first transistor for one with that could handle a little more power. I used the highest rated NPN transistor from my variety pack. In my case, this happened to be the 2N2222.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my new circuit at hand, I was ready to test. But then nothing happened. I was befuddled. Like many people online, I was running a 1K ohm transistor into the base of my transistor. But it wasn’t doing anything. Okay, maybe my GPIO pin from the ESP32 was still putting out too much current into the transistor base?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grabbed a higher rated resistor from my bag, this time 220k ohm. Why did I pick that one? It was the first bag of resistors on top of my pile that was greater than 1K ohm. Besides, what did I have to lose by using a transistor with too much resistance (besides burning it out)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the most anti-climactic fashion, it worked. My machine could both be triggered from the physical button, and the GPIO pin on my ESP32. I was almost ready to put it back together. There were just a few loose ends I needed to tie up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;extra-credit&quot;&gt;Extra Credit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I wanted to add in a small LED that would let me know when my circuit triggered. This would help me debug if something wasn’t working correctly. I slapped on a green LED, added some code to ensure it went off at the same time. Piece of cake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to adding a status LED for my commands, I also did something super hacky. I noticed there was an open pad on the circuit board inside my noise machine. This open pad allowed me to tap into any voltage passing through the power LED. Can you guess where I’m going with this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I soldered a wire to that pad and connected it to an input pin on my ESP32. Now whenever the device was on, I could read the voltage from the power LED’s circuit and know for certain what its state was. This would allow me to reflect in the Home Assistant user interface if someone had turned the noise machine on with the physical button so that the UI toggle would correctly represent the machine’s state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the video demo where I control the noise box with my voice. Don’t worry, &lt;strong&gt;I muted the Google hot phrase&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, my Home Assistant instance already had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nabucasa.com/config/google_assistant/&quot;&gt;Google Home integration&lt;/a&gt;. This meant once I had the ESP32 module connected using ESPHome, I only needed to expose the entity to Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voice control was now a success. My dumb noise machine went through a transformation stuffed with wires and an ESP32 module. No more decisions needed to be made on whether I wanted to suffer with the creaking all night, or end up dashing across the frozen carpet to turn it on. My &lt;del&gt;dumb&lt;/del&gt; &lt;em&gt;smarter&lt;/em&gt; noise machine was fully controllable from my cozy warm bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;source-code&quot;&gt;Source Code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the source configuration of my ESP32 board if anyone wants to try this, or use some of it to control their own devices.&lt;/p&gt;

This means a user could create an endpoint to be hit from an external source and start a task. In my case, I wanted to use webhooks from Plex to dim (or brighten) my lights as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;problems-with-other-methods&quot;&gt;Problems with other methods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me be upfront. Plex webhooks are only available to users to are subscribed to PlexPass. I also want to note that this requires a Home Assistant instance to be set up with the ability to control the lights. In my case, I’m using Hue bulbs because of their fairly open API. Before landing on using webhooks through Home Assistant, I considered a few other options to automate my lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hellohue&quot;&gt;HelloHue&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One common method of controlling the lighting with Plex playback is using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ledge74/HelloHue.bundle&quot;&gt;HelloHue&lt;/a&gt;. The issue here is that plugins are becoming deprecated with Plex, and I can’t control more complicated automations. For example, I have an automation to make sure my lights won’t dim if I am preparing a meal in the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tautulli&quot;&gt;Tautulli&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another common method of controlling lights with Plex is using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Tautulli/Tautulli&quot;&gt;Tautulli&lt;/a&gt;. Tautulli can be set up to watch for certain playback behaviors, filter users, and post an MQTT message to a channel that Home Assistant is watching. This is an &lt;em&gt;OK&lt;/em&gt; method, but I found that this introduced a small amount of lag and would require another application to be working at all times if I didn’t want my lighting automations to hiccup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;node-red&quot;&gt;Node-RED&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last option that I had considered (and used for quite some time), was adding a webhook endpoint inside of Node-RED. This was an &lt;em&gt;OK&lt;/em&gt; method as well, but I try to keep things secure. My problem with this method is the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I prefer to avoid exposing local network applications to the internet without it being necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I prefer to access local network applications with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SSL&lt;/code&gt;. If it’s an internal app, I will use a self-signed certificate by my local CA. If it’s an external facing app, I look to sign it with Let’s Encrypt. In my head, this makes me feel a little bit better in case a device on my network is compromised and begins snooping.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Node-RED webhook endpoint is unable to run both &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/code&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HTTPS&lt;/code&gt; at the same time. I’m not quite sure why this occurred, but it may have something to do with the Node-RED implementation I am using. This means I cannot use SSL locally on Node-RED if I want to use the webhook from Plex.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Without setting up a (reverse?) proxy through nginx (or the likes) and using an external CA like &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/&quot;&gt;Let’s Encrypt&lt;/a&gt;, I’m unable to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; requests from Plex webhooks because Plex does not recognize my local CA (and why would it?) causing them to fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sticking-with-home-assistant-webhooks&quot;&gt;Sticking with Home Assistant webhooks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means the solution I chose to use were the newly introduced webhooks for Home Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My rationale behind this decision is that because I am already exposing Home Assistant externally, and I would prefer not to open another attack vector with Node-RED, I might as well just use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HTTPS&lt;/code&gt; endpoint on Home Assistant. If I was not already exposing Home Assistant externally, I likely would have kept using the non-ssl webhook from Node-RED locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.home-assistant.io/t/plex-webhooks-wip/73095&quot;&gt;Home Assistant community post&lt;/a&gt;, rossdargan had this great idea to parse the incoming &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/code&gt; (disguised in a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;form-data&lt;/code&gt; message), and push it back to the local MQTT server so it could be read properly by the automations. I added the following to my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;automations.yaml&lt;/code&gt; and it worked great. I’m still not completely satisfied with the parsing though. I do wish it was using a proper parsing library instead..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;parsing-and-sending-the-payload-to-mqtt&quot;&gt;Parsing and sending the payload to MQTT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plex webhooks have a problem where they send their &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;json&lt;/code&gt; payload with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Content-Type&lt;/code&gt; header of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;form-data&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;application/json&lt;/code&gt;. That’s why we have have to parse the “&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;” from the payload first, and repost it through a local MQTT channel before being able to interpret it as a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;json&lt;/code&gt; object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Home Assistant automations.yaml&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;1539725480000'&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Plex Webhook MQTT&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;trigger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;webhook&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;webhook_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;!secret&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;plex_webhook&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;mqtt.publish&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;data_template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;topic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;plex/update'&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;payload_template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;{{ (trigger.data['payload'] | string)[12:][:-2] | replace (&quot;\\\\&quot;, &quot;\\&quot;) | replace (&quot;\\\'&quot;, &quot;'&quot;) | replace (&quot;\\x&quot;,&quot;?&quot;) }}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;receiving-the-mqtt-message&quot;&gt;Receiving the MQTT message&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that automation is set, we can listen to the MQTT channel and check its conditions. In the automation below, I check to see who is watching TV and which player UUID they are using. I’m not sure the best way to find the UUID other than checking the logs or debugging the Plex webhook messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once these conditions are met, I check the playback state of the event being received. If it’s starting/resuming, I flip on a boolean value for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;plex_playback&lt;/code&gt;. If it’s stopping/pausing, I flip that boolean value off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That boolean value is what I use to determine the playback state for my other automations in Node-RED. In my case, it works like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;plex_playback&lt;/code&gt; value is turned on, I will check the following conditions in Node-RED before dimming the lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Is anyone cooking in the kitchen?&lt;/code&gt; If true, don’t dim the kitchen lights.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Is this content the morning news?&lt;/code&gt; If true, don’t dim any lights. I need to wake up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Is the master light override control on?&lt;/code&gt; If true, leave all lights where they are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;plex_playback&lt;/code&gt; value is turned off, I will check the following conditions in Node-RED before brightening the lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Is the sun angle lower than 8°&lt;/code&gt; If true, don’t brighten the lights. It’s too late at night for that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Is the master light override control on?&lt;/code&gt; If true, leave all lights where they are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the automation for changing the boolean value:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Home Assistant automations.yaml&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;1539522762000'&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Plex State Toggle&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;trigger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;mqtt&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;topic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;plex/update'&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;condition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;condition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;conditions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;condition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;service_template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;{% if ((trigger.payload_json.event == 'media.play') or (trigger.payload_json.event == 'media.resume')) %}&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;input_boolean.turn_on&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;{% elif ((trigger.payload_json.event == 'media.pause') or (trigger.payload_json.event == 'media.stop')) %}&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;input_boolean.turn_off&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;{% endif %}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;entity_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;input_boolean.plex&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After HomeAssistant introduced their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nabucasa.com/config/webhooks/&quot;&gt;Cloud Webhook&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0.84.0&lt;/code&gt;, my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;payload_template&lt;/code&gt; for the incoming WebHooks needed to be changed to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;{{ (trigger.data | string)[154:][:-55] }}&lt;/code&gt; until HomeAssistant is able to handle JSON payloads in multipart data WebHooks. It’s a &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; solution and entirely based on assumed headers of the payload, but it works for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you have it. The quickest (non-deprecated) method I could come up with for changing my lights when starting/stopping content on Plex. I’m sure there are ways to improve this. That’s ok, I don’t mind. This was only a weekend project to improve my lighting events. If only Plex states could be monitored as quickly as my Chromecast can be. One can only dream…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;image&quot;=&gt;&quot;/assets/img/kyle.jpg&quot;, &quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;&quot;CrypticCitrus&quot;}</name></author><category term="small project" /><summary type="html">Last week, the Home Assistant project launched webhooks triggers for automations. This means a user could create an endpoint to be hit from an external source and start a task. In my case, I wanted to use webhooks from Plex to dim (or brighten) my lights as quickly as possible. Problems with other methods Let me be upfront. Plex webhooks are only available to users to are subscribed to PlexPass. I also want to note that this requires a Home Assistant instance to be set up with the ability to control the lights. In my case, I’m using Hue bulbs because of their fairly open API. Before landing on using webhooks through Home Assistant, I considered a few other options to automate my lights. HelloHue One common method of controlling the lighting with Plex playback is using HelloHue. The issue here is that plugins are becoming deprecated with Plex, and I can’t control more complicated automations. For example, I have an automation to make sure my lights won’t dim if I am preparing a meal in the kitchen. Tautulli Another common method of controlling lights with Plex is using Tautulli. Tautulli can be set up to watch for certain playback behaviors, filter users, and post an MQTT message to a channel that Home Assistant is watching. This is an OK method, but I found that this introduced a small amount of lag and would require another application to be working at all times if I didn’t want my lighting automations to hiccup. Node-RED The last option that I had considered (and used for quite some time), was adding a webhook endpoint inside of Node-RED. This was an OK method as well, but I try to keep things secure. My problem with this method is the following: I prefer to avoid exposing local network applications to the internet without it being necessary. I prefer to access local network applications with SSL. If it’s an internal app, I will use a self-signed certificate by my local CA. If it’s an external facing app, I look to sign it with Let’s Encrypt. In my head, this makes me feel a little bit better in case a device on my network is compromised and begins snooping. The Node-RED webhook endpoint is unable to run both HTTP &amp;amp; HTTPS at the same time. I’m not quite sure why this occurred, but it may have something to do with the Node-RED implementation I am using. This means I cannot use SSL locally on Node-RED if I want to use the webhook from Plex. Without setting up a (reverse?) proxy through nginx (or the likes) and using an external CA like Let’s Encrypt, I’m unable to POST requests from Plex webhooks because Plex does not recognize my local CA (and why would it?) causing them to fail.

On this Home Assistant community post, rossdargan had this great idea to parse the incoming JSON (disguised in a form-data message), and push it back to the local MQTT server so it could be read properly by the automations. I added the following to my automations.yaml and it worked great. I’m still not completely satisfied with the parsing though. I do wish it was using a proper parsing library instead.. Parsing and sending the payload to MQTT Plex webhooks have a problem where they send their json payload with a Content-Type header of form-data instead of application/json. That’s why we have have to parse the “data” from the payload first, and repost it through a local MQTT channel before being able to interpret it as a json object. # Home Assistant automations.yaml - id: '1539725480000' alias: Plex Webhook MQTT trigger: platform: webhook webhook_id: !secret plex_webhook action: - service: mqtt.publish data_template: topic: 'plex/update' payload_template: &amp;gt; {{ (trigger.data['payload'] | string)[12:][:-2] | replace (&quot;\\\\&quot;, &quot;\\&quot;) | replace (&quot;\\\'&quot;, &quot;'&quot;) | replace (&quot;\\x&quot;,&quot;?&quot;) }} Receiving the MQTT message After that automation is set, we can listen to the MQTT channel and check its conditions.

I’m not sure the best way to find the UUID other than checking the logs or debugging the Plex webhook messages. Once these conditions are met, I check the playback state of the event being received. If it’s starting/resuming, I flip on a boolean value for plex_playback. If it’s stopping/pausing, I flip that boolean value off. That boolean value is what I use to determine the playback state for my other automations in Node-RED. In my case, it works like this: If plex_playback value is turned on, I will check the following conditions in Node-RED before dimming the lights. Is anyone cooking in the kitchen? If true, don’t dim the kitchen lights. Is this content the morning news? If true, don’t dim any lights. I need to wake up. Is the master light override control on? If true, leave all lights where they are. If plex_playback value is turned off, I will check the following conditions in Node-RED before brightening the lights. Is the sun angle lower than 8° If true, don’t brighten the lights. It’s too late at night for that. Is the master light override control on? If true, leave all lights where they are. Here’s the automation for changing the boolean value: # Home Assistant automations.yaml - id: '1539522762000' alias: Plex State Toggle trigger: platform: mqtt topic: 'plex/update' condition: condition: and conditions: - condition: template value_template: &quot;{{trigger.payload_json.Account['title'] == 'PLEX_USER' }}&quot; - condition: template value_template: &quot;{{trigger.payload_json.Player['uuid'] == 'PLAYER_UUID' }}&quot; - condition: template action: service_template: &amp;gt; {% if ((trigger.payload_json.event == 'media.play') or (trigger.payload_json.event == 'media.resume')) %} input_boolean.turn_on {% elif ((trigger.payload_json.event == 'media.pause') or (trigger.payload_json.event == 'media.stop')) %} input_boolean.turn_off {% endif %} entity_id: input_boolean.plex After HomeAssistant introduced their Cloud Webhook in 0.84.0, my payload_template for the incoming WebHooks needed to be changed to {{ (trigger.data | string)[154:][:-55] }} until HomeAssistant is able to handle JSON payloads in multipart data WebHooks.

Repetitive tasks annoy me and I try to find the best way to optimize activities. Earlier this year when Google Home rolled out custom routines, a weird behavior involving lights and routines prevented me from syncing my new Philips Hue bulbs with Google Home. This was a huge pain point for me because I always use my voice to command my lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My attempt at solving this problem led me into a massive project of shifting control from my smart devices wherever possible into my own hands. Granted there are still external services that are still required for a few of my devices, but this got me closer to full control. My solution was using the open source project &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.home-assistant.io/&quot;&gt;Home Assistant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home Assistant is an automation platform that has +1,000 components for different devices and services. It’s written in Python3, has an &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.home-assistant.io/&quot;&gt;active community&lt;/a&gt;, and openly accepts contributions into its project. Home Assistant’s large library of compatible devices made it easy for me to hook up all of my smart plugs, smart lights, and other silly &lt;em&gt;smart&lt;/em&gt; devices. I personally run Home Assistant on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/home-assistant/hassio#readme&quot;&gt;Hass.io&lt;/a&gt;, a Docker-based system that handles Home Assistant updates and runs very well on my Raspberry Pi 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fixing-my-lack-of-light-control&quot;&gt;Fixing My Lack of Light Control&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first started working with Home Assistant, I wanted to solve only one problem. Controlling my lights using my voice. This was a two stage process. The first was connecting my lights to Home Assistant, and the second step was connecting a voice interface to Home Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-one&quot;&gt;Step One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connecting up Home Assistant to my Hue Lights took less than five minutes. As soon as Home Assistant started up, its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.home-assistant.io/components/discovery/&quot;&gt;discovery service&lt;/a&gt; automatically prompted to authenticate locally on my network with my Hue hub. What a piece of cake. I could now control the lights from the Home Assistant web interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-two&quot;&gt;Step Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commanding my lights using my voice was another simple-ish task. All I needed to do was set up a Google Actions project and connect it to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.home-assistant.io/components/google_assistant/&quot;&gt;Google Assistant&lt;/a&gt; component. I was already  familiar with Actions on Google which made hooking this up trivial. However, I don’t use this exact component anymore because Actions on Google unpublishes &lt;em&gt;test projects&lt;/em&gt; after a few days (which breaks my syncing). I have since switched to using Google Assistant via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.home-assistant.io/cloud/google_assistant/&quot;&gt;Home Assistant Cloud&lt;/a&gt; component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-did-i-really-fix&quot;&gt;What Did I Really Fix?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2018/06/xkcd_automation.png&quot; alt=&quot;xkcd Automation&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Automation (&lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/1871/&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think understand what you’re about to say; “Kyle, I thought you were trying to get away from the cloud, not build your own components in the cloud!” To that I would say you are absolutely correct! All I did was shift the cloud problem from my Google Home… back to my Google Home… huh. But remember, I can still control my devices locally if I pull up the web interface on my network… but then I could just open the Hue App on my phone. &lt;em&gt;What was I solving by doing this again?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very least, I fixed being able to control my lights using my voice. Even if I’m using the exact same vocal interface. Plus, now I had this wonderful automation tooling that I could use streamline tasks in my apartment. Let’s break down what I use to help with my automations and a few of my favorite examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;automating-mundane-tasks&quot;&gt;Automating Mundane Tasks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first started working on automation with Home Assistant, I was using its built-in YAML files to carry out tasks. I learned very quickly that this was extremely tedious as I had to reload my Home Assistant automations whenever I wanted to test them. It was also incredibly difficult to debug these types of automations. That’s when I came across the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AYapejian/node-red-contrib-home-assistant&quot;&gt;Home Assistant nodes&lt;/a&gt; for Node-RED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea behind using Node-RED is that Home Assistant will maintain all of the entity states and services while Node-RED controls the conditions and behaviors from those state changes. The Home Assistant node allows me to access the Home Assistant API directly within Node-RED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, my vacuuming automation inside Node-RED checks with Home Assistant to see whether or not the house is occupied or empty. When Node-RED detects that the occupancy status from Home Assistant is empty, it continues to check if the current time is within the vacuum scheduler timeframe. If it is, send a service call to Home Assistant telling the vacuum to start. This flow can be seen below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2018/06/automation_vacuum.png&quot; alt=&quot;Node-RED Vacuum Flow&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Node-RED Vacuum Flow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think about that xkcd comic from earlier, this is a ridiculously complicated flow when I could just ignore the vacuum automation and use its built-in scheduling. But that’s not how we do things around here, is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few other notes on this vacuum flow. I give my vacuum the courtesy of turning on all the lights when it starts running so it can see objects in a clear view. One may also notice the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node-red-contrib-persist&lt;/code&gt; node which maintains the last known state between flow redeploys. I also have an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rbe&lt;/code&gt; (Report by Exception) node which allows me to ignore repeated commands. This ensures that the vacuum doesn’t schedule itself more than once per day by accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Be careful with this one. If you mess up and reset your trigger condition at 1 AM and it starts vacuuming, your significant other will not be very happy when they are awoken by a vacuum and bright lights. &lt;em&gt;Speaking from experience…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sample-automations&quot;&gt;Sample Automations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few samples of my favorite automations set up around the apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dim-the-lights-with-media-playback&quot;&gt;Dim the Lights With Media Playback&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dim the kitchen and living room lights if I am watching something on Plex or Chromecast.
 On &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pause&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stop&lt;/code&gt;, restore the lights back to full brightness only if the sun is above a certain horizon angle.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;But wait, now if someone is cooking in the kitchen while the other person is trying to watch a show, the cook will have trouble seeing. Ok, insert a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cooking mode&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;input_boolean&lt;/code&gt; to prevent dimming specific lights. Solved.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2018/06/automation_playback.png&quot; alt=&quot;Media Playback Flow&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Media Playback Flow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;improving-the-philips-hue-colorloop&quot;&gt;Improving the Philips Hue Colorloop&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create my own colorloop for Philips Hue bulbs because the built-in API colorloop effect moves nauseatingly fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2018/06/automation_colorloop.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hue Colorloop Flow&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hue Colorloop Flow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you’re wondering what’s inside the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;colorwave&lt;/code&gt; node, it’s a piece of JavaScript that I hacked together to rotate through the peak color coordinates on each RGB channel for the best looking light. It’s probably more complicated than it needs to be, but breaking it down like this helps me understand what each component of the code is performing. I make use of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;flow&lt;/code&gt; variables a lot to keep the configuration parameters easy to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;timeout&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;flow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;transitionTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rainbow&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;#FF0000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;#FF8000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;#FFFF00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;#80FF00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;#00FF00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;#00FF80&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;#00FFFF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;#0080FF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;#7F00FF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;#FF00FF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;#FF007F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;welcoming-each-occupant-home&quot;&gt;Welcoming Each Occupant Home&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When someone arrives home, turn on the lights (+ set the bedroom to their favorite color scene), and broadcast their arrival over all Google Home speakers.
 We also have it set up to turn off all lights and switch to Eco mode if every person has left the apartment.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;But what if the other person is sleeping? Then we need to make sure that we add in a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sleeping mode&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;input_boolean&lt;/code&gt; that disables the announcement and prevents changing the bedroom lights.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;morning-news-with-a-switch&quot;&gt;Morning News with a Switch&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is a bit custom but it should give a cool idea on something to automate. I’ve found that the local news streams their broadcast online, and it is compatible with my Chromecast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Node-RED, I can watch for specific button presses of my Hue light switch in the morning between 5:00 AM-7:00 AM. I use that trigger to turn my CEC-friendly TV on and cast the morning news. All with a single button press in my kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really gives me the feeling of living in one of those future movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home Assistant and Node-RED make a wonderful pairing to control smart devices around the domicile. They have fixed many problems for me with applications like the geo-fencing from Hue, slow eco-mode for Nest, and the broken implementation of Google Home routines. Putting control back in the user’s hands of each device allows them to avoid being locked into a single ecosystem, and in some cases avoid concerns about a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tweethue/status/1002258308210798592&quot;&gt;cloud outage&lt;/a&gt; for their devices. This pair makes an excellent start on bringing home automation back home.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;image&quot;=&gt;&quot;/assets/img/kyle.jpg&quot;, &quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;&quot;CrypticCitrus&quot;}</name></author><category term="large project" /><summary type="html">I’m a big fan of automation. Repetitive tasks annoy me and I try to find the best way to optimize activities. Earlier this year when Google Home rolled out custom routines, a weird behavior involving lights and routines prevented me from syncing my new Philips Hue bulbs with Google Home. This was a huge pain point for me because I always use my voice to command my lights. My attempt at solving this problem led me into a massive project of shifting control from my smart devices wherever possible into my own hands. Granted there are still external services that are still required for a few of my devices, but this got me closer to full control. My solution was using the open source project Home Assistant. Home Assistant is an automation platform that has +1,000 components for different devices and services. It’s written in Python3, has an active community, and openly accepts contributions into its project. Home Assistant’s large library of compatible devices made it easy for me to hook up all of my smart plugs, smart lights, and other silly smart devices. I personally run Home Assistant on Hass.io, a Docker-based system that handles Home Assistant updates and runs very well on my Raspberry Pi 3.

Controlling my lights using my voice. This was a two stage process. The first was connecting my lights to Home Assistant, and the second step was connecting a voice interface to Home Assistant. Step One Connecting up Home Assistant to my Hue Lights took less than five minutes. As soon as Home Assistant started up, its discovery service automatically prompted to authenticate locally on my network with my Hue hub. What a piece of cake. I could now control the lights from the Home Assistant web interface. Step Two Commanding my lights using my voice was another simple-ish task. All I needed to do was set up a Google Actions project and connect it to the Google Assistant component. I was already familiar with Actions on Google which made hooking this up trivial. However, I don’t use this exact component anymore because Actions on Google unpublishes test projects after a few days (which breaks my syncing). I have since switched to using Google Assistant via the Home Assistant Cloud component. What Did I Really Fix? Automation (Source) I think understand what you’re about to say; “Kyle, I thought you were trying to get away from the cloud, not build your own components in the cloud!” To that I would say you are absolutely correct! All I did was shift the cloud problem from my Google Home… back to my Google Home… huh. But remember, I can still control my devices locally if I pull up the web interface on my network… but then I could just open the Hue App on my phone. What was I solving by doing this again? At the very least, I fixed being able to control my lights using my voice. Even if I’m using the exact same vocal interface. Plus, now I had this wonderful automation tooling that I could use streamline tasks in my apartment. Let’s break down what I use to help with my automations and a few of my favorite examples. Automating Mundane Tasks When I first started working on automation with Home Assistant, I was using its built-in YAML files to carry out tasks. I learned very quickly that this was extremely tedious as I had to reload my Home Assistant automations whenever I wanted to test them. It was also incredibly difficult to debug these types of automations. That’s when I came across the Home Assistant nodes for Node-RED. The idea behind using Node-RED is that Home Assistant will maintain all of the entity states and services while Node-RED controls the conditions and behaviors from those state changes. The Home Assistant node allows me to access the Home Assistant API directly within Node-RED. For example, my vacuuming automation inside Node-RED checks with Home Assistant to see whether or not the house is occupied or empty. When Node-RED detects that the occupancy status from Home Assistant is empty, it continues to check if the current time is within the vacuum scheduler timeframe. If it is, send a service call to Home Assistant telling the vacuum to start. This flow can be seen below. Node-RED Vacuum Flow If you think about that xkcd comic from earlier, this is a ridiculously complicated flow when I could just ignore the vacuum automation and use its built-in scheduling. But that’s not how we do things around here, is it? There are a few other notes on this vacuum flow. I give my vacuum the courtesy of turning on all the lights when it starts running so it can see objects in a clear view. One may also notice the node-red-contrib-persist node which maintains the last known state between flow redeploys. I also have an rbe (Report by Exception) node which allows me to ignore repeated commands. This ensures that the vacuum doesn’t schedule itself more than once per day by accident. Be careful with this one. If you mess up and reset your trigger condition at 1 AM and it starts vacuuming, your significant other will not be very happy when they are awoken by a vacuum and bright lights. Speaking from experience… Sample Automations Here are a few samples of my favorite automations set up around the apartment. Dim the Lights With Media Playback Dim the kitchen and living room lights if I am watching something on Plex or Chromecast. On pause/stop, restore the lights back to full brightness only if the sun is above a certain horizon angle. But wait, now if someone is cooking in the kitchen while the other person is trying to watch a show, the cook will have trouble seeing. Ok, insert a cooking mode input_boolean to prevent dimming specific lights. Solved. Media Playback Flow Improving the Philips Hue Colorloop Create my own colorloop for Philips Hue bulbs because the built-in API colorloop effect moves nauseatingly fast. Hue Colorloop Flow In case you’re wondering what’s inside the colorwave node, it’s a piece of JavaScript that I hacked together to rotate through the peak color coordinates on each RGB channel for the best looking light. It’s probably more complicated than it needs to be, but breaking it down like this helps me understand what each component of the code is performing. I make use of the flow variables a lot to keep the configuration parameters easy to change. var timeout = flow.get(&quot;transitionTime&quot;) * 1000; var rainbow = [&quot;#FF0000&quot;, &quot;#FF8000&quot;, &quot;#FFFF00&quot;, &quot;#80FF00&quot;, &quot;#00FF00&quot;, &quot;#00FF80&quot;, &quot;#00FFFF&quot;, &quot;#0080FF&quot;, &quot;#7F00FF&quot;, &quot;#FF00FF&quot;, &quot;#FF007F&quot;]; rainbowPosition = flow.get(&quot;rainbowPosition&quot;); // Flow value that starts at 0. if (msg.payload === &quot;on&quot;) { flow.set(&quot;rainbowId&quot;, setInterval(sendColors, timeout)); } function sendColors() { checkRainbowPosition(); flow.set(&quot;rainbowPosition&quot;, flow.get(&quot;rainbowPosition&quot;) + 1); node.send({ payload: {&quot;on&quot;:true, &quot;hex&quot;:rainbow[flow.get(&quot;rainbowPosition&quot;)-1], &quot;transitionTime&quot;:flow.get(&quot;transitionTime&quot;)} }); } function checkRainbowPosition(){ if ( flow.get(&quot;rainbowPosition&quot;) &amp;gt;= rainbow.length) { flow.set(&quot;rainbowPosition&quot;, 0); } } Welcoming Each Occupant Home When someone arrives home, turn on the lights (+ set the bedroom to their favorite color scene), and broadcast their arrival over all Google Home speakers. We also have it set up to turn off all lights and switch to Eco mode if every person has left the apartment. But what if the other person is sleeping? Then we need to make sure that we add in a sleeping mode input_boolean that disables the announcement and prevents changing the bedroom lights. Welcome Home Flow Morning News with a Switch This one is a bit custom but it should give a cool idea on something to automate. I’ve found that the local news streams their broadcast online, and it is compatible with my Chromecast. Using Node-RED, I can watch for specific button presses of my Hue light switch in the morning between 5:00 AM-7:00 AM. I use that trigger to turn my CEC-friendly TV on and cast the morning news. All with a single button press in my kitchen. It really gives me the feeling of living in one of those future movies. Additional Useful Home Assistant Components DarkSky API gathers hyperlocal weather information at the apartment and can be presented on the Home Assistant dashboard. Presence Detection from Home Assistant helps identify who is home or away. Floorplan for Home Assistant is an interactive tool that allows a user to toggle/open/view entities from Home Assistant on a user created SVG layout of their living space. Floorplan example Conclusion Home Assistant and Node-RED make a wonderful pairing to control smart devices around the domicile. They have fixed many problems for me with applications like the geo-fencing from Hue, slow eco-mode for Nest, and the broken implementation of Google Home routines. Putting control back in the user’s hands of each device allows them to avoid being locked into a single ecosystem, and in some cases avoid concerns about a cloud outage for their devices. This pair makes an excellent start on bringing home automation back home.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.kyleniewiada.org/assets/img/2018/06/banner.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Improving Jekyll in 2017</title><link href="https://www.kyleniewiada.org/blog/2017/02/improving-jekyll-2017/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Improving Jekyll in 2017" /><published>2017-02-22T05:34:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-12-10T05:25:24-05:00</updated><id>https://www.kyleniewiada.org/blog/2017/02/improving-jekyll-2017</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.kyleniewiada.org/blog/2017/02/improving-jekyll-2017/">&lt;p&gt;When I took a look at my website last year, it needed help. There wasn’t a whole lot wrong, but there definitely were areas that needed improvement. For starters, I wasn’t testing anything (don’t judge me). How would I test things? By overkilling the project and setting up &lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/&quot;&gt;Travis-CI&lt;/a&gt; of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, my website felt a little bulky. The CSS was over-the-top, I didn’t need a JavaScript header menu, I had unnecessary nested HTML tags, and still didn’t like how some of the elements collapsed on mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last major change that I wanted to implement was &lt;strong&gt;AMP&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ampproject.org/&quot;&gt;accelerated mobile pages&lt;/a&gt;) to make is easier for mobile devices hitting my blog. This led down a rabbit hole of further changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;line-separator&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;testing&quot;&gt;Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My website needed testing. I had no excuse. With every new feature added, there was another chance that something would slip by and ruin my production release. After adding AMP, I would manually validate each page in Google Chrome using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#development=1&lt;/code&gt; tag in my URL. For every change the HTML layout, I would miss a close tag. This needed to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;html-proofer&quot;&gt;HTML Proofer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first improvement to testing my website was adding &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer&quot;&gt;HTMLProofer&lt;/a&gt;. HTMLProofer “is a set of tests to validate your HTML output. These tests check if your image references are legitimate, if they have alt tags, if your internal links are working, and so on. It’s intended to be an all-in-one checker for your output.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cool, right? After I set up the RubyGem, I found some broken HTML tags, a few 404 outgoing links, and missing alt tags on images. A few problems solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;amphtml-validator&quot;&gt;amphtml-validator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I implemented AMP (more on that later), I needed a better way to test rather than opening up my browser and validating each page through the Chrome dev tools. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/tree/master/validator/nodejs&quot;&gt;amphtml-validator&lt;/a&gt; to the rescue; a Node.js package command line tool that validates AMP HTML files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a little Ruby-Fu, I was able to add the Node.js package execution to my Rakefile. It finds all of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;*.html&lt;/code&gt; files in my AMP directory and passes them one at a time to the amphtml-validator. I check the exit status of the Node.js package, let the user know if it fails, and continue with my day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Rakefile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;desc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Test website AMP validation'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;task&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:amp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Running AMP Validator...'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;yellow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;bold&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;amp_dir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'_site/amp'&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;system&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;find &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;amp_dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; -iname *.html | xargs -L1 amphtml-validator&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;$CHILD_STATUS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;exitstatus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;zero?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'AMP Validator finished successfully.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'AMP Validator FAILED.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;bold&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vg&quot;&gt;$CHILD_STATUS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;exitstatus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rubocop&quot;&gt;RuboCop&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was working on a pull request for another project, the project’s Rake tests introduced me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop&quot;&gt;RuboCop&lt;/a&gt;. RuboCop is a static code analyzer for Ruby that enforces guidelines from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide&quot;&gt;Ruby Style Guide&lt;/a&gt;. It was a neat little tool that I added to my Rakefile to ensure Ruby code that I wrote would be understood by others. It wasn’t a huge change, but it was there to keep myself in check with the community style guidelines (something that I had very little experience with).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added this to my project by installing the RuboCop RubyGem and adding its config file. The config file excludes a directory that would currently break a Travis-CI build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.rubocop.yml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;AllCops&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;Exclude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;vendor/**/*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Ignore Travis-CI build directory&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;travis-ci&quot;&gt;Travis-CI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding tests were great. But I also liked the idea that if I was away from my build environment I could make a small change on my phone, test it, and deploy to production. This was a bit of a pipe dream for me. I knew as soon as I added tests, I wouldn’t be able to rely completely on GitHub builds. Likewise, if I wanted to add special plugins or RubyGems, say goodbye to GitHub builds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/&quot;&gt;Travis-CI&lt;/a&gt; saves the day! Travis-CI will watch for code changes in my repo, fetch it, test it, and if it passes it could push my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_site/&lt;/code&gt; folder to my GH-Pages branch (where GitHub will deploy online). Pretty cool, huh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stumbled across this idea from Savas Labs who wrote a blog post last fall on how they &lt;a href=&quot;https://savaslabs.com/2016/10/25/deploy-jekyll-with-travis.html&quot;&gt;deploy to GitHub Pages using Travis-CI&lt;/a&gt;. They were not the first, but I liked some of the ideas that they used. They would bring in pull requests to the source branch, test it, and deploy to a master branch for GH-Pages based on test results. I have followed suit. I made some changes to the scripts, like how I cache different directories and rely on the built in Node.JS versions, but the idea is still the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m actually a little proud of this, but my build time is now around 1½ minutes, and deploying only takes another 15 seconds. This was accomplished by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Caching Bundler&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Caching Node_Modules&lt;/li&gt;

This shaved nearly a minute off the build!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;amp-pages&quot;&gt;AMP Pages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting back in the middle of 2016, I wanted to implement AMP (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ampproject.org/&quot;&gt;accelerated mobile pages&lt;/a&gt;) in my website. In case you didn’t know, it’s a streamlined version of the webpage strongly optimized for mobile rendering and reduced load times. It also comes with its own special restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there was something that would make the web experience faster for any readers, I was interested. My biggest problems were that Jekyll had yet to implement multiple layouts natively. This meant that I needed to rely on an external plugin in order to generate the AMP pages. Good thing I setup up Travis-CI!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/juusaw/amp-jekyll&quot;&gt;amp-jekyll&lt;/a&gt; (which is now a RubyGem!) to add an AMP layout. There were a few small changes that I needed to make though. I had to figure out how to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-video&quot;&gt;properly add videos&lt;/a&gt; to my posts, remove the AMP pages from my sitemap, and change the canonical URL on my AMP pages while using Jekyll-SEO-Tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;amp-sitemap-conflict&quot;&gt;AMP Sitemap Conflict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to avoid duplicate results, AMP pages are not &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JohnMu/status/786588362706673664&quot;&gt;necessary in the sitemap&lt;/a&gt; unless they are standalone pages. Referencing them in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; of the normal page is enough. Because &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap&quot;&gt;jekyll-sitemap&lt;/a&gt; knew nothing about my AMP ambitions, I had to manually set a default in my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;amp.html&lt;/code&gt; layout frontmatter to stop them from being included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_layouts/amp.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;layout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;amp&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;sitemap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;amp-seo-fixes&quot;&gt;AMP SEO Fixes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, my AMP pages had conflicts with  &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag&quot;&gt;Jekyll-SEO-Tag&lt;/a&gt;. Every AMP page would list its canonical URL as itself, when in reality it should be linking to the normal version of the webpage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;This was solved by cheating. I call it cheating because it’s not a robust solution. If I happen to include the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;site.ampdir&lt;/code&gt; anywhere in my SEO tags on an AMP page, that text will be removed.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new method of changing the canonical url on AMP pages is accomplished by removing the first instance of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;site.ampdir&lt;/code&gt; in my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;page.url&lt;/code&gt; on pages whose layout is of type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;amp&lt;/code&gt;. I then rebuild the canonical url in the same format as Jekyll SEO Tag and update the JSON-LD with a small replace filter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If my AMP Page canonical URL contained &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/amp&lt;/code&gt; like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;href=&quot;https://www.kyleniewiada.org/amp/blog/2017/02/improving-jekyll-2017/&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would now be altered to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;href=&quot;https://www.kyleniewiada.org/blog/2017/02/improving-jekyll-2017/&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever I grab the SEO tag, I make sure to run in through my “parser” first to fix it. Here’s how I do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_includes/amp-check.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-liquid highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;capture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;seo_text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;%}{%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;seo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;%}{%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;endcapture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;SEO&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;
  &amp;lt;!-- Assumes AmpDir is always first instance in page.url based on how amp-jekyll builds it --&amp;gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;assign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;canonical_amp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;absolute_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;assign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;canonical_amp_removed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;remove_first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;site.ampdir&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;absolute_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;seo_text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;canonical_amp&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;canonical_amp_removed&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;endif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now all I need to do is call the Jekyll-SEO-Tag with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;{% include amp-check.html src=&quot;SEO&quot; %}&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; of my layout. Problem solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;amp-videos&quot;&gt;AMP Videos&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMP Videos require a bit of finesse to implement. They need to have a special JS file loaded in the head and they need to follow the correct &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-video&quot;&gt;amp-video guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fixing-the-head&quot;&gt;Fixing the &amp;lt;Head&amp;gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get that &lt;em&gt;special JS file&lt;/em&gt;, I decided the easiest way would be to add a frontmatter variable in each post stating which special AMP JS files were needed. Then I would make a check for it in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. For example, a blog post with an embedded video would have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;amp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;video&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the AMP &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; layout would include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_includes/amp/head.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{% if page.amp contains 'video' %}
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;custom-element=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;amp-video&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-video-0.1.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
{% endif %}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fixing-the-post&quot;&gt;Fixing the Post&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; had the correct dependencies, I had to figure out how to embed the video file in my blog post in the appropriate way for each page layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was accomplished with a small &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;include&lt;/code&gt; that would take in the parameters from a post specifying the video type and other special properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would add a video to my post with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-liquid highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;video&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/assets/files/2016/03/bug_example.mp4&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;poster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/assets/files/2016/03/bug_example_poster.png&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;controls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;loop&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the video &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;include&lt;/code&gt; would properly insert the video for both AMP and default layouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_includes/video.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-liquid highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Method to implement AMP-Video. --&amp;gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;assign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;420&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;assign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;700&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;assign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;normal&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the code above, it first checks to see if the video type from the post is a “normal” embedded video, or a YouTube video (not shown). Next, it checks to see if the webpage layout is of type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;amp&lt;/code&gt;. If this is also true, then it will insert the correct HTML layout for an AMP video. Otherwise, it will insert the video with normal HTML5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You can find more information or any updates to my implementation on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aav7fl/aav7fl.github.io/wiki&quot;&gt;repo Wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when I run the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;amphtml-validator&lt;/code&gt; tests, all of my AMP pages pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Running AMP Validator...

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An explanation on my testing method is found earlier in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-improvements&quot;&gt;Other Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of testing/building, there were a few other improvements that I made to my website. I fixed conflicts with AMP pages and other plugins, added a wiki to the website repo, and put forth a small graphical upgrade with favicon branding and banners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;plugins&quot;&gt;Plugins&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in this post I talked about how I was using Travis-CI to build and deploy my website. Building outside of GitHub offered me the freedom to use my own plugins or RubyGems rather than limiting myself to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/versions/&quot;&gt;GitHub-Pages Allowed Dependencies&lt;/a&gt;. One of them I’ve already mentioned; amp-jekyll. This was used to implement an AMP layout to my blog postings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only custom RubyGem that I am using is Jekyll-SEO-Tag. Well… a fork of Jekyll-SEO-Tag. That is, until they hopefully accept my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag/pull/151&quot;&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt;. My pull request corrects and updates the JSON-LD for a blog post to meet Google’s current recommendations. But for now, I have a special entry in my Gemfile pointing to my fork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gemfile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;group&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:jekyll_plugins&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'https://github.com/aav7fl/jekyll-seo-tag.git'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'jekyll-seo-tag'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;branch: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'testing'&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;website-wiki&quot;&gt;Website Wiki&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aav7fl/aav7fl.github.io/wiki&quot;&gt;wiki to my website repo&lt;/a&gt;
so others could build out their own project from my website if they wanted to. Additionally, the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt; for my repo was becoming far too large to include all of the information about how to build, customize, and deploy my website. This meant that I could make separate changes to the documentation without adding another code commit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;less-code-is-more&quot;&gt;Less Code is More&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I made a substantial improvements to the CSS, lightened the webpage layout, and squashed remaining bugs that I could find (looking at you MS Edge…). Below is a fairly comprehensive list of the major changes I made. They don’t deserve their own individual section, but they are still worth mentioning&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Removed CSS normalize/Strongly simplified&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Removed complicated JavaScript header navigation (CSS3 only now)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Switched post-navigation and footer to use Flexbox that collapses responsively&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Switched to HTML5 tags (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;main&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed SVG banner image bugs that existed in Edge/IE and iOS Safari
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Edge/IE would not dislpay the SVG banner if it met the following conditions:
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Set as a CSS background-image&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Displayed with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;background-size: cover;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Stretched too wide (it would disappear immediately).
This was resolved by adding &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x=&quot;0&quot; y=&quot;0&quot;&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;filter&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag in my SVG file. What a bug…&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;iOS Safari would display the banner with a smokey-white haze when using the Gaussian Blur filter as it somehow conflicted with the background layer. This was resolved by removing the background fill from the SVG and instead handling it with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;DIV&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;background:&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added favicon sets (like Apple-Touch-Icon) using &lt;a href=&quot;https://realfavicongenerator.net/&quot;&gt;RealFaviconGenerator&lt;/a&gt; with updated colors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’ve had a reader mention &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.websiteplanet.com/webtools/favicon-generator/&quot;&gt;WebsitePlanet&lt;/a&gt; an alternative to RealFaviconGenerator. WebsitePlanet generates a bunch of different sizes at the same time; so keep that in mind if one website does it better than the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I tried to stay entirely within the GitHub Pages ecosystem, it didn’t fit my needs. But that was a good thing. This gave me the chance to check out other build environments and different tools that wouldn’t have been in my reach before. This gave me the opportunity to look at other open source projects, to learn about their process, and contribute my own work back.&lt;/p&gt;

They like to sneak in wallpapers, silly animations, or a fun little game. With the release of Android Nougat (7.0.0), the Easter Egg ended up resembling some kind of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neko_Atsume&quot;&gt;Neko Atsume&lt;/a&gt; themed game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept is quite simple. Once on Android 7.X.X, after &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.howtogeek.com/269207/how-to-enable-android-nougats-cat-collecting-easter-egg/&quot;&gt;adding the Easter Egg&lt;/a&gt;, the player pulls down their notification menu and selects a piece of food to place out. Certain pieces of food net the player a better chance at catching a cat, but these pieces of food respectively take longer before a cat will eat it. After a cat eats the piece of food, the player will be given a chance of catching it depending on what piece of food was placed out. If they succeed the random check, the player will receive a notification and the cat will appear in their inventory. If they fail, the cat will get away with the food and the player will only find an empty bowl with no notification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2017/01/bluecat.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dark blue cat from Android Nougat Easter Egg&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jack’s Mannequin. Because he’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5LjFkibA7w&quot;&gt;Dark Blue&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;google-gamifying-notifications&quot;&gt;Google Gamifying Notifications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s silly. It really is. But I like looking at these cats and it’s almost like &lt;em&gt;Google is gamifying the process of me checking my notifications&lt;/em&gt;…and that appears to be happening. They are keeping our vested interest by getting us to return to our notifications with the hope of discovering something new. I like this game..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like my little collection of cats so much that I wanted to find a way to back them up. My phone is an LG Nexus 5X. I probably could’ve stopped at LG and you might have been able to guess what the problem is. My phone is probably doomed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LG has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techtimes.com/articles/186940/20161125/lg-cant-fix-nexus-5x-bootloop-issue-so-its-offering-full-refunds.htm&quot;&gt;pretty&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/lg-g4-bootloop-problem-how-to-diagnose-and-fix&quot;&gt;large-scale&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.androidauthority.com/lg-v10-bootloop-problem-711334/&quot;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; with  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.androidauthority.com/lg-bootloop-whats-going-on-735474/&quot;&gt;recent phones bootlooping&lt;/a&gt;. When I check out the results of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nexus5x/&quot;&gt;Nexus 5X Subreddit&lt;/a&gt;, I find horror stories of LG and their support. But I digress. I use the Nexus 5X for the latest Android updates, its cheaper cost, and Project Fi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the possible impending doom on my Nexus 5X, I wanted to find a way to back it up and keep the cats safe. My requirement, I didn’t want to root. A short while ago, I transferred over all of my devices from being rooted and jailbroken to running stock because of how much easier it was to maintain. If I was rooted, I would just turn to Titanium Backup and call it a day. But I couldn’t do that. Not without unlocking my bootloader and rooting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After little bit of research, I found that ADB has this nifty built-in feature that can &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Android/adb&quot;&gt;backup applications&lt;/a&gt; and their data without root.
I threw on USB debugging, connected my phone to the computer, and wrote the following line to back up my Android Nougat Cats with a script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;adb&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;backup&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;CatsBackup_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ab&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;android&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;egg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;system&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the command above is run in Windows Command Prompt, a few screens will appear on the phone to confirm the backup and possibly enter a password to encrypt it. ADB will create a small file with today’s date on my C: drive named &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CatsBackup_20170104.ab&lt;/code&gt; (January 04, 2017) and it will contain the backup data for my cats. If you’re not using Windows Command Prompt, go ahead and change the file name to whatever you’d like. I just wanted to make it scriptable for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To restore, simply run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;adb&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;restore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;CatsBackup_20170104&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ab&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a few issues at first where it wouldn’t restore properly. But after the data was erased for the Easter Egg, I was able to successfully restore one of my backups. That could just be my luck, and others might succeed restoring it over their current cat collection on the first try. But if you’re looking to back up your cat collection, this looks like the way to go. You should be able to restore this on any phone (Not sure how it will handle it on a newer version of Android though).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Update May 9, 2017: WolfLeader116 wrote a really nice batch script to simplify the process of backing up/restoring and posted it on Pastebin (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pastebin.com/59LnfS7M&quot;&gt;https://pastebin.com/59LnfS7M&lt;/a&gt;). Check out their &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/01/backing-up-android-nougat-cats/#comment-3295881956&quot;&gt;explanation in the comments&lt;/a&gt; below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Update November 11, 2017: I recently upgraded my phone to the Pixel 2 and it must have been a weird upgrade process because my Neko game was a frozen-like state. This is because the activation activity had not occurred so the game was not allowed to run. To manually activate the game on Android Oreo, you just need to run the following ADB Shell command. A little cat will pop up on the bottom of your screen like a toast notification and you should be good to go (except the notifications when you find a cat are broken/sharing the cat crashes the app after it successfully exports).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I’ve been known to walk into a room and shout “okay Google” hoping to hear a device accepting my query. Since early 2015, people have been able to use Google Now to send Hangouts messages. I tried jumping on that bandwagon but every time I attempted to send a message, I was greeted with the response &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;No Google profile for &amp;lt;Contact&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2016/07/noaccountphone.png&quot; alt=&quot;No Google profile for contact found&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Google profile found on my phone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It worked fine if I was sending an SMS, but never with a Hangouts message. There are a &lt;a href=&quot;https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/hangouts/8Qm5O5ekTG4&quot;&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/hangouts/spcmG8qtgiA&quot;&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt; of others finding their own solution or having a server-side fix rolled out. But this was not the solution for me. I tried everything from factory resetting my phone, sideloading the Google contacts app, even loading an Android ROM on a backup phone and retrying the voice commands. But nothing worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-there-were-three&quot;&gt;First There Were Three&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until a few months ago that I realized I had somehow acquired &lt;em&gt;three Google+ profiles&lt;/em&gt; tied to my email. This was a little strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My first Google+ account was set up and tied to my primary account.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My second Google+ account was created as a separate profile for my YouTube account &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2663685&quot;&gt;described here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When I was managing my accounts I noticed that I had a third one. It appeared that Google had made a Google+ &lt;a href=&quot;https://business.google.com/create&quot;&gt;business page&lt;/a&gt; for my YouTube’s Google+ account. Or maybe I did this by mistake, but I don’t recall going through the creation process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I had three Google+ accounts tied to my primary email. When I tried to speak a Google Now Hangouts command, it would not find any contacts. Honestly, I can’t remember if it ever worked before then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a theory. I thought that there might be a conflict in which route my Google Now commands were following to gather my contacts. The first thing I did was &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/plus/answer/1044503&quot;&gt;delete my Google+ business page&lt;/a&gt; because it wasn’t linked to anything. Next, I tried to delete my Google+ page linked to my YouTube channel. However, because it was linked, I could not delete it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/account_transfer_channel&quot;&gt;This setting&lt;/a&gt; allowed me to switch my connected Google+ profile on my YouTube channel. After severing the link, I was then able to close my old YouTube’s Google+ account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;then-there-was-one&quot;&gt;Then There Was One&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I was down to a single Google+ profile. I tried ringing off my voice command “okay Google, send a hangouts message to &amp;lt;Contact&amp;gt;”… And it worked! Unlinking and removing the excess Google+ profiles fixed the path for Google Now finding my contacts.

I have an application that communicates with my uninterruptible power supply to shut down my machine in the event of a power outage after a few minutes. If this program estimates less than five minutes of reserve power, the program will broadcast a notification in the system taskbar (with sound!) letting me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;UPDATE: After the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, misbehaving applications no longer re-register an entry for notifications. This guide has now been made out of date as hiding Windows Notifications will now handle behavior correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are familiar with Windows, then you know that there is a feature that allows you to hide notifications and icons to programs in the system tray. However, this application does not seem to respect those rules. Every time the application launches, it appears to reassociate itself and reset all settings made to keep it quiet. If I did manage to mute it, the changes would not survive a system reboot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notification is posted frequently, as my system’s max power draw while gaming will trigger the UPS power draw warning. I found this to happen quite frequently when I was playing in virtual reality and it was continually breaking my immersion by ringing out system notifications in the middle of &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/322770/&quot;&gt;Vanishing Realms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that this is to help prevent the user from unknowingly leaving their system vulnerable during an outage when the user is not there. But if I lose power while in my VR headset, I am going to know very quickly that my machine should be shut off (not to mention my entire VR world will go black).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to keep the functionality of my uninterruptible power supply communications program, but I also wanted to remove the annoying notification. I did a bit of digging inside the Windows registry (Windows 10 64-bit) and found to be what looks like a set of the registry keys responsible for relaying an application notification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;removing-the-notification&quot;&gt;Removing the Notification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;em&gt;very quick and dirty&lt;/em&gt; registry hack to prevent applications from relaying notifications in the system taskbar. Windows notifications are sent by writing to a parent registry key associated with an application. Each application will attempt to add notifications as a sub-key to the registered parent key. By removing my user’s permission to write to the parent key, the application will be unable to add sub-keys, and silently fails when it attempts to send notifications. I have not noticed any problems yet, but your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case it helps, my machine is using Windows 10 Pro 64-bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;finding-the-notification-key&quot;&gt;Finding the Notification Key&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is to find the key inside the registry associated with the application. Browse to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Notifications\Current\
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One will find a list of keys for applications registered for the system notifications. If the application you’re looking for does not immediately jump out, it is probably one of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Microsoft.Explorer.Notification.{XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX}&lt;/code&gt; keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only information that I could find about this and how the key is decided is the claim that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/issues/1777#issue-98981400&quot;&gt;it is the application GUID&lt;/a&gt;. However, my research has found that this registry key does not match the GUID for the installed application. My theory is that it is randomly generated upon install. But I have not yet verified this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2016/07/regedit0.png&quot; alt=&quot;The notification for my battery adding a subkey in the registry&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The notification for my battery adding a subkey in the registry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the registered application has no notification to display, there will be no subkeys listed for that registry key. However, while a notification is displayed, one can refresh the registry editor (F5 key) and see that a subkey has been added. This will help identify which registry keys are associated with the application notifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;removing-control-permissions&quot;&gt;Removing Control Permissions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, control permissions need to be removed from that specific registry key. Right-click on the parent key and select &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Permissions…&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2016/07/regedit1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Editing Windows registry permissions&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Select the user currently logged into the machine and deny &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Full control&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Read&lt;/code&gt; permissions. Apply these changes. Attempt to re-create the application notification in the taskbar. If unable to re-create, the correct changes were made. If not, undo the changes and try looking for the key again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2016/07/regedit2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Denying full control permissions in Windows registry&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes should allow for the removal of annoying applications that do not follow the proper guidelines or rules when it comes to Windows taskbar notifications. Sometimes programs have unintended consequences when the programmer makes assumptions about how and when a user will interact with their program. I was hit with a combination of a program that did not properly register notifications as well as provide no advanced options to disable such notifications (there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; other advanced options under the program).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone out there has a better method or would like to point out any unforeseen consequences with this, please let me know. For everyone else, this should help tame such applications inside their Windows taskbar.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;image&quot;=&gt;&quot;/assets/img/kyle.jpg&quot;, &quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;&quot;CrypticCitrus&quot;}</name></author><category term="small project" /><summary type="html">A few weeks ago a Windows application on my computer was broadcasting notifications that I did not care for.

I had a friend in college demo an Oculus DK1 to me and I was pretty amazed; even though I was running it on a laptop and the display drivers turned everything into wireframe models. I remember getting my hands on my first Google Cardboard, sliding my phone in, and exploring the world through Google Earth. When the HTC Vive went on sale with its advertised room-scale, I bought it. My first real chance to become heavily immersed in a virtual world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;UPDATE (10/27/2016): After the most recent Raspbian update, I need to use an external powered USB hub for my wireless adapter. This is necessary to use the 5 GHz band which requires more power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, my HTC Vive setup did not fit in my room. I ended up running some cables to put it in the room next door. But there was a problem. I wanted to let those around me in the VR room see what I was seeing. I had to figure out a way to mirror or broadcast my desktop to the other room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first thought was that I was going to use my Steam Link as a way to rebroadcast desktop. After all, it’s another product by Valve and its primary function is for streaming games. I thought this was going to work because it had the feature to minimize the Steam Big Picture application and use the desktop instead. But as I began to find out, this did not work with all Steam VR applications and the usability of the HTC Vive suffered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I launched games from my Steam Link, I could no longer use the VR menu. If I tried to launch the Steam Link after I was in the VR menu, it would refuse because I was already “in game”. I tried using alternative software such as Splashtop (Remote software) to stream it to my device, but it was unable to draw the desktop unless I forced it; this interfered with my Vive yet again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After failing to use the Steam Link and Splashtop, I came across others mentioning Nvidia’s GameStream as an alternative to streaming gameplay. Nvidia has a built-in feature with their new-ish graphics cards that allow one to stream their gaming setup to an Nvidia Shield tablet. I did not own a Nvidia Shield tablet. Luckily there was an open source client alternative, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/irtimmer/moonlight-embedded&quot;&gt;Moonlight Embedded&lt;/a&gt;, that would allow streaming to a number of different clients. Sure, I could have probably set up a VNC server/VNC client but who knows how long it would have taken for me to get optimized for streaming games, and where was the fun in that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was settled. I was going to install Moonlight Embedded to my Raspberry Pi 2. Here is my setup so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-i-used&quot;&gt;What I used:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Raspberry Pi 2 running Raspbian Jessie (May 2016) using NOOBS
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Including peripherals such as micoSD card, HDMI cable, case, mouse, keyboard, USB micro power adapter, a method to connect to home network such as wireless adapter or ethernet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Computer with Windows 10&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nvidia GTX 970 graphics card&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/irtimmer/moonlight-embedded&quot;&gt;Moonlight Embedded&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-up-the-pi&quot;&gt;Setting Up the Pi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that I did was install the latest Raspbian Jessie release on my Raspberry Pi 2 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/&quot;&gt;using NOOBS&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;s&gt;I originally was using the TP-LINK TL-WDN3200 wireless adapter with my Raspberry Pi to connect on the 5 GHz network. But as I found out later, this was a problematic adapter.&lt;/s&gt;  I was able to get the TP-LINK TL-WDN3200 working perfectly. I needed to remove DHCPCD (and the default network manager) and use WICD to manage my wireless adapter as DHCPCD appeared to make some kind of aggressive roaming check every minute creating a severe lag on my wireless signal. Make sure the Raspberry Pi is connected to the Internet before continuing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my installation was finished, I followed the Moonlight Embedded directions found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/irtimmer/moonlight-embedded/wiki/Packages&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding the line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;deb http://archive.itimmer.nl/raspbian/moonlight jessie main
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to this file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;/etc/apt/sources.list
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And running the following to install Moonlight Embedded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;apt-get update
apt-get &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;moonlight-embedded
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once everything was complete, Moonlight Embedded was installed on my Pi and ready to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-up-the-computer&quot;&gt;Setting Up the Computer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I switched over to my desktop, opening up Nvidia GeForce Experience, and added the information below as a custom Shield game. Out of the box, Moonlight Embedded will launch you to the Steam Big Picture mode and leave you with the same problem as the Steam Link; getting stuck with Steam’s streaming mess. However, with Nvidia GeForce Experience, we can add the ability to stream the desktop without interfering with SteamVR at all. In Nvidia GeForce Experience, add the custom game to GameStream found below .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application below is Windows’ built-in remote desktop software. It is what I use it to access my PC machine from the Pi in a separate room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2016/05/GFEWindow.png&quot; alt=&quot;Adding remote desktop as Nvidia GameStream custom game&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adding remote desktop as a Nvidia GameStream custom game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-text highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Name: RemoteDesktop
Target: &quot;C:\Windows\System32\mstsc.exe&quot;
Start in: C:\Windows\System32
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;finishing-the-pi&quot;&gt;Finishing the Pi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To finish the setup, Raspberry Pi needs to be paired as a GameStream client to your PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To initiate pairing, type the following on your Raspberry Pi terminal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;moonlight pair 192.168.1.X
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Replace 192.168.1.X with your PC’s IP, which can be found by typing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ipconfig&lt;/code&gt; into the Windows command prompt and matching it with your network interface&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once pairing has been initiated, a window will pop up on the Windows desktop prompting for a code to be entered. Type in the pairing code presented on the Raspberry Pi into your desktop window, and then you should be successfully paired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a handy streaming script for my own needs to start streaming on the Raspberry Pi found below. It adds in a few extra lines to disable screen blanking such that my remote session does not freeze or become unusable if my Raspberry Pi enters standby mode. However, none of the extra lines will be necessary &lt;em&gt;unless&lt;/em&gt; you change your /boot/config.txt to turn off the monitor when the screen blanks. Make sure to give the script execute permissions and you should be able to run it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the rest of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/irtimmer/moonlight-embedded/tree/master/docs&quot;&gt;documentation arguments&lt;/a&gt;. Your settings will probably differ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#Disable screen saver blanking.&lt;/span&gt;
xset s off

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#Disable Energy Star features.&lt;/span&gt;
xset &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-dpms&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#Start the Moonlight stream. Make sure to replace the remote address with your own computer's IP.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#This is probably the only necessary command unless you make other changes to Raspbian&lt;/span&gt;
moonlight stream &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-1080&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-60fps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-bitrate&lt;/span&gt; 20000 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-localaudio&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-app&lt;/span&gt; RemoteDesktop 192.168.1.X

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#Enable screen saver blanking&lt;/span&gt;
xset s off

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#Turn off power saving screen features.&lt;/span&gt;
xset s on

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#Enable Energy Star features.&lt;/span&gt;
xset +dpms
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t forget! Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Q quits the streaming session.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-problems-and-solutions&quot;&gt;My Problems and Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My installation wasn’t very smooth. I had a lot of problems along the way that kept setting me back and extended the project duration for a couple days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-raspberry-pi-was-extremely-slow-at-downloading&quot;&gt;My Raspberry Pi was extremely slow at downloading.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not receiving enough power so I do use a different USB adapter to give it more. I didn’t realize that’s what the flashing logo on the top right corner meant. But once I did figure it out, my download speeds over my network soared past the 1 Mbit that I was getting before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;audio-would-not-stream&quot;&gt;Audio would not stream.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My audio wouldn’t stream at first to my Raspberry Pi because I wasn’t using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-localaudio&lt;/code&gt; flag. This meant that the primary sound device was changing, then SteamVR was also attempting to change the primary audio device to the HTC Vive, and they were both conflicting with each other. If I did manage to have it to stream to the special Nvidia audio driver, I found it to stutter quite a bit. So I resolved this issue by using the local audio flag to prevent my sound device from changing, and mirroring the SteamVR audio to my primary sound driver on my computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wireless-streaming-stuttered-every-60-seconds-for-10-seconds&quot;&gt;Wireless streaming stuttered every 60 seconds for 10 seconds.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;s&gt;My wireless adapter was the primary culprit to this. There was some issue with it either being powered or sharing band with on the USB bus with my Raspberry Pi. I switched to my handy [IOGear Ethernet/Wireless adapter](http://www.amazon.com/IOGEAR-Universal-Ethernet-Adapter-GWU627/dp/B004UAKCS6) and have had little problems streaming 20 Mbit streams. This adapter might not work for everybody. It uses the 2.4 GHz band which is commonly known to be quite crowded. My Raspberry Pi is near the wireless access point, so it has little interference.&lt;/s&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to get my 5 GHz wireless adapter working after uninstalling the newly introduced DHCPCD wireless manager and switching to WICD. I also added “max_usb_current=1” “/boot/config.txt” to prevent my wireless adapter from using all available power from the USB ports. Everything works flawlessly now over wireless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-hdmi-monitor-would-not-turn-off-after-screen-blanking-with-the-pi&quot;&gt;My HDMI monitor would not turn off after screen blanking with the Pi.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added the undocumented/unsupported &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hdmi_blanking 1&lt;/code&gt; to the bottom of my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/boot/config.txt&lt;/code&gt; file and rebooted. This allowed my monitor to enter standby mode when the Raspberry Pi screen blanked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;if-my-monitor-turned-off-in-a-remote-session-i-could-not-turn-it-back-on-without-killing-the-session&quot;&gt;If my monitor turned off in a remote session, I could not turn it back on without killing the session.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I enabled the ability for the monitor to shut down when the screen blanked off, if I was in a remote session and my Pi entered standby mode, I would be unable to escape because my Pi did not see any wake events as they were all being handed off to my remote session. My solution to this was just a bit more of a lazy hack. I decided to create a script (listed above) that turns off the power saving features before I enter streaming modesave file and restore them after ending the stream. This ensures that I will not get stuck with a monitor in standby while streaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-had-buffering-issues&quot;&gt;I had buffering issues.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;s&gt;I solved this simply by playing with the bit rate level. I decided to stick with 10 Mbits for a 720p 60fps stream. In the past 10 days, I've only had the stream freeze once. It's successful enough for me.&lt;/s&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stream no longer freezes on me after getting the 5 GHz adapter working and the compression artifacts are extremely minimal. It looks great in 1080p/60 FPS.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;image&quot;=&gt;&quot;/assets/img/kyle.jpg&quot;, &quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;&quot;CrypticCitrus&quot;}</name></author><category term="medium project" /><summary type="html">I think virtual reality is a lot of fun.

Originally, I was going to edit the blog post to incorporate new guide steps, but I soon realized that I was straying away from the scope of that blog post; to outline and describe the process I took to recover my save collection. Below are the steps to follow if you would like to backup your save file for the Nintendo 64 game, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;required-tools&quot;&gt;Required tools:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Linux Mint (live CD will work too)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;You can choose whatever Linux distro you would like, but the tutorial steps may not match with other Linux distros.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A Working Nintendo 64 (and controller)

      &lt;li&gt;It would be best if you could connect this to a TV so you can see the screen. Although I guess if someone makes a TASBot, you wouldn’t need a TV for it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8 MB Expansion Pak&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nintendo 64 GameShark with a working parallel port
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A working parallel port can usually be found on cartridge versions 3.2 and 3.3&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Computer with a working parallel port&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Parallel cable
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Other users were unable to get a USB to parallel cable to work. I would advise against using an adapter.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Super Mario 64
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Or equivalent. This game is only needed to boot GameShark and change keycode for Ocarina of Time.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-one-preparing-the-transfer-computer&quot;&gt;Part One: Preparing the Transfer Computer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have your machine (with the parallel port) turned on and booted into its Linux partition or a Live CD equivalent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On that machine download the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/parasyte/n64rd/releases&quot;&gt;latest release&lt;/a&gt; of N64RD. This tutorial uses version 0.2.0.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unzip its contents and navigate to the directory using a terminal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To build N64RD, we need to install ‘scons’. From the command line, run:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; sudo apt-get install -y scons
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After scons has finished installing, in the directory of the unzipped code, to build N64RD run:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; scons
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2016/05/term.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Terminal Output&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your directory should now contain the ‘n64rd’ commandline executable file.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leave the terminal open and your machine on during the next few steps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-two-preparing-the-nintendo-64&quot;&gt;Part Two: Preparing the Nintendo 64&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If your Nintendo 64 freezes at any point, you will need to power down your Nintendo 64 and begin again from Part Two: Step 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the 8 MB Expansion Pak is installed in your Nintendo 64.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect the Nintendo 64 to the television, and plug in the power cable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Insert Super Mario 64 into the GameShark, and insert the GameShark into the Nintendo 64.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn on your TV and the Nintendo 64.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once the GameShark main menu has appeared, select ‘key codes’, scroll down to the keycode named “Zelda”, and activate it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn off your Nintendo 64.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take out the Super Mario 64 cartridge and replace it with the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect your Nintendo 64 GameShark to your transfer computer with your parallel cable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn on your Nintendo 64.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to the cheat menu and disable all cheats for Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. This is to prevent any cheat conflicts from interfering with our RAM dump.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Next, press the start button to load the ‘Start Game Options’ menu.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn on the code generator.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Launch the game with codes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Load the save file from the main menu that you wish to dump. Only one save may be dumped from RAM at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After the game has loaded, press pause.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-three-the-transfer&quot;&gt;Part Three: The Transfer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2016/05/setup.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;N64 Transfer Setup&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If everything is still running normally, on your transfer computer execute a RAM dump by running the following command with N64RD in the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; $ ./n64rd -dmemory.z64 -a 0x80000000 -l 0x00800000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This will take quite some time. I think I recall somewhere in the neighborhood of 10-20 minutes. After the execution begins, your game will probably freeze. This is fine.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When N64RD has finished executing, you should have an 8 MB RAM dump file in that folder named ‘memory.z64’. Congratulations! You have dumped the active memory of the Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time. You may now power down your Nintendo 64.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-four-extracting-the-save&quot;&gt;Part Four: Extracting the Save&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a previous blog &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2015/04/transferring-n64-saves/&quot;&gt;outlining the process&lt;/a&gt; I used to dump my Ocarina of Time save file, the user Bkacjios took some of that information to create a online RAM dump to save file converter. It will extract your save file from the RAM dump and generate a save file with a good checksum (making it a valid non-corrupt save).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2016/05/banner.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ocarina of Time save converter&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href=&quot;http://zeldaspeedruns.wikia.com/wiki/Version_Differences&quot;&gt;this wiki&lt;/a&gt; to determine which Ocarina of Time cartridge version you have.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Navigate to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bkacjios.github.io/OOT-Save-Converter/&quot;&gt;https://bkacjios.github.io/OOT-Save-Converter/&lt;/a&gt;, import your RAM dump, select the correct cartridge version, and download your save file. Feel free to change any of the other options before downloading such as the file slot or other game settings.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Congratulations! You have successfully dumped your Ocarina of Time RAM and extracted your save file to be used with emulators and other tools.&lt;/li&gt;

Originally, I was going to edit the blog post to incorporate new guide steps, but I soon realized that I was straying away from the scope of that blog post; to outline and describe the process I took to recover my save collection. Below are the steps to follow if you would like to backup your save file for the Nintendo 64 game, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.kyleniewiada.org/assets/img/2016/05/banner.jpg" /></entry></feed>
