Here I am. My own small little corner of the internet. A centralized location; a place to call home.

Let me start off with a few formalities. My name is Kyle Niewiada (/kaɪl niː-viː-ɑː-də/). If the phonetic spelling it correct, it should read something very close to _k-eye-l knee-vee-ah-da_. I've been playing the piano for a while now. I enjoy writing. Computers will always fascinate me. This website will hopefully be the center of my online presence.

On this site I hope to share my [latest musical projects/demos](http://music.kyleniewiada.org) and [archive](/archive/) about my latest and most interesting projects.

If you haven't figured it out already, I enjoy writing music and performing it on the piano. This interest has stemmed from an underlying passion towards enjoying the piano. It's slightly hard to explain. Many kids who play piano were forced into that activity from their parents. I was nearly the opposite. I _wanted_ to learn how to play the piano and had to convince my parents to let me take lessons. Looking back, this turned out to be a great decision. I am nowhere near the professional level of playing (or sight reading) but I thoroughly enjoy <strike>playing on a piano</strike> music. I'm sure many can relate to the feeling of being unbothered with their favorite hobby.

Writing music for the piano is a strong passion for me. I don't need to become a concert pianist or a classical genius to enjoy it. I have found my own way to keep this activity connected into my life. It's an outlet-- a different world. If you take away anything from reading this post, I'd like you to realize that.

This is a start.

Keep listening  
-Kyle
